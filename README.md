## The problem: e-Mobility for All
Electric mobility (e-Mobility) is a way to limit the carbon footprint caused by our urban and sub-urban mobility needs. When using an electric vehicle, knowing where to charge the vehicle and carefully planning the charging process in such a way that it introduces minimal interference and constraints on
our daily schedule is of paramount importance.
